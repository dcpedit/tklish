# TKLish

TKLish is a series of PCBS that mimic the style of a traditional TLK (Ten Key Less) keyboard.  Below are the 3 variants:

* s40 - 40% layout with staggered keys
* o40 - 40% layout with ortholinear keys
* o80 - 80% layout with ortholinear keys

Features:

* s40 can use standard keycaps (no 40s kit required)
* s40 & o80 can utilize any ergo/ergodox kit with 1.5u modifier keys (ex. GMK Sixes, SA Carbon)
* PCB can support up to 3 rotary encoders
* Utilizes Unified Daughterboard (C4 version with Molex Pico-EZmate connectors)

The o80 PCB should work with any case that does require the PCB to be mounted (PCB has no mounting holes) and utilizes a USB-C daughterboard.  I've only been able to test it with the Thecca x Rubrehose case.

## Stacked Acrylic Case

I've designed a stacked acrylic case that works with the 40% PCBs.  You can look at the build guide in the [cases](./cases) directory.
