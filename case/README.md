This guide is for building a case for the TKLish s40 & o40 PCBs

## Components

| Caps lock LED | 1 | |
| Caps lock resistor | 1 | 1k -10k|
| Rotary encoder | 0 - 3 | EC11 |
| Encoder knob | 0 - 3 | 18mm diameter |
| Plate foam | 1-2 | 3.5mm (or 1.5mm + 2mm) EVA |
| Switch plate | 1 | 1.5mm or 3mm acrylic |
| Stabalizers | 0 - 6 | PCB mount |
| Acrylic case layers | 7-8 | Including switch plate
| M2x24mm standoff | 4 | Case perimeter (upper) |
| M2x13mm standoff | 4 | Case perimeter (lower) |

## Case Layers
These are the layers that are labeled in the Illustrator file.  All the layer should be 3mm in thickness except for #4a and #4b, which are 1.5mm. 

| Layer Name | Count | Description |
| ---- | ----- | ----------- |
| #1 Top Layer | 1 | 3mm thickness |
| #2 - #3 Top Spacers | 2 | 3mm thickness |
| #4a Plate 1.5mm | 1 | 1.5mm thickness |
| #4b Plate Spacer 1.5mm | 1 | 1.5mm thickness |
| #5 Bottom Spacer | 1 | 3mm thickness |
| #6 Bottom Spacer | 1 | 3mm thickness |
| #7 Bottom | 1 | 3mm thickness |
| #8 Feet4 | 1 | 3mm thickness |
| #9 Feet3 | 1 | 3mm thickness |
| #10 Feet2 | 1 | 3mm thickness |
| #11 Feet1 | 1 | 3mm thickness |
| Foam Plate 3.5mm | 1-2 | 3.5mm (or 1.5mm + 2mm) EVA |

## Assembly Steps

### Solder switch sockets

Place some solder on one of the hot swap socket pads.  There should ben enough solder to make a small mound.  Place the socket into position and melt the mound of solder that was previously added while pressing down on the center of the socket.  Be sure to avoid touching any metalic parts to prevent burns.  Keep the soldering iron on the pad long enough for the solder to flow around the socket connector (usually around 3 to 4 seconds).  Now solder the other socket connector to the pad.

### Solder rotary encoders

Insert rotary into the front of the PCB, solder, and clip off the pins with a flush cutter.

### Install stabalizers

The number and size of the stabalizers will vary based on your chosen layout.

### Assemble plate, plate foam, and switches

If you're using a 3mm plate, you can optionally use 2mm plate foam.  If you're using a 1.5mm plate + 1.5mm spacer, you can optionally use 3.5mm plate foam.  Line up the plate foam on top of your PCB if you're using it, and line up the switch plate on top of the foam.  Then insert your switches, making sure they are fully seated against the switch plate (no gaps).

## Case Assembly


### Layer #11

Attach 4 M2x24mm standoffs to this layer with 4 M2x6mm screws.

### Layers #7-10

![layers7-10](https://i.imgur.com/7HneNOJ.jpeg)

Line the top holes up with the standoffs and place the layers on top.  Attach 4 M2x13mm standoffs to the bottom of layer #7 with 4 M2x6mm screws.

### USB-C Daughterboard

![foam tape](https://i.imgur.com/0K5pUiO.jpeg)

Cut a small piece of foam tape and attach it to the bottom of the daughterboard.

### Attach Daughterboard

Expose the other side of the adhesive and press the daughterboard into the slot.

### Daughterboard Cable

Attach one end of the cable to the daughterboard and loop any extra inside the cable cutout.

### Spacer Layers #5 - 6

Slide these spacer layers by ligning up the standoffs with the holes.

### Switch Plate Layer #4

If you're using a 1.5mm switch plate, you will need to place the 1.5mm spacer in first.  Then place your assembled switch plate on top.

### Layer #1 - 3

Line up the remaining layers with the standoffs and stack them on top.

### Top screws

![top screws](https://i.imgur.com/cdCFw9p.jpeg)

Use 8 M2x8mm screws to fasten the top to the standoffs.

### Adhesive bumpers

You can add adhesive bumpers to the corners of the bottom
